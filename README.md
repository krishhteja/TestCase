# TestCase
A simple program with test cases written with help of selenium


Implement a program that will get a string as an input. For that input string program needs to update all letters alternately to uppercase and lowercase letters so that first letter is an uppercase and second lowercase etc… In addition all numbers are changed either to letter o/O or e/E depending whether number is odd or even. If number is odd then it will be changed to letter o/O and if even then to e/E. Other than letters and numbers are left as those are and update meant to be done for that one will move forward until there will be next letter or number. Below are two test cases

 
input: testisyöte
output: TeStIsYöTe


input: num 5 on pariton
output: NuM o On PaRiToN


In addition to the program write a test program that tests your program. Test program can be for example a unit test or other self-written test progrman. If you are doing assumption then include those also to the return.
